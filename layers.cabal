description:
  The @layers@ package provides the type class machinery needed to make monads
  built out of stacks of monad transformers easy to use. It introduces the
  concept of monad layers, which are a generalisation of monad transformers.
  The type class machinery provided by and the design patterns suggested by
  @layers@ allow for much more modularity than is possible with the existing
  type class machinery and design patterns. With @layers@ it is possible to
  use arbitrary monad interfaces (monad interfaces are what we call the sort
  of type classes that you see in the @mtl@ and similar packages) with
  arbtirary monad transformers (by monad transformers here, we are
  specifically to monad constructors, such as the ones defined in
  @transformers@), without ever having to explicitly define how to lift
  specific interfaces through specific transformers.
  .
  @layers@ improves upon and/or replaces, in part or in whole, the following
  list of packages: @transformers@, @mtl@, @mmtl@, @transformers-base@,
  @monad-control@, @lifted-base@, @monad-peel@, @MonadCatchIO-transformers@,
  @MonadCatchIO-mtl@, @exception-transformers@, @monad-abort-fd@ and probably
  more too. There have been many attempts to either improve upon or work
  around the deficiencies of the existing type class machinery for monad
  transformer stacks, but we believe @layers@ is the most complete of any of
  these so far.
  .
  A comprehensive overview of the motivation behind @layers@ and an
  explanation of the design decisions taken is given in
  "Documentation.Layers.Overview". It is /highly recommended/ that you read
  this if you are considering using this package. The core type classes of the
  package are defined in "Control.Monad.Layer" (this can be thought of as
  equivalent to or a replacement of "Control.Monad.Trans.Class" from
  @transformers@). The rest of the modules in this package export monad
  interfaces, in the "Control.Monad.Interface" hierarchy, including
  replacements for all of the monad interfaces of the @mtl@ package.
